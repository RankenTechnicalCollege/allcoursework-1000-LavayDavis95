            <p>Magneto is a powerful mutant, one of a fictional subspecies of humanity born with superhuman abilities, 
              who has the ability to generate and control magnetic fields. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily 
              superior to humans and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he initially aimed 
              to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as Homo superior, to replace humans as the
               dominant species, and occasionally advocated for human genocide.</p>
